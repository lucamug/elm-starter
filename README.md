# elm-starter

`elm-starter` is an experimental Elm-based Elm bootstrapper that can also be plugged into already existing Elm applications.

Post ["elm-starter", a tool for the Modern Web](https://dev.to/lucamug/elm-starter-a-tool-for-the-modern-web-53b1).

Example of the installed version, with and without Javascript enabled:

## How to bootstrap a new project

`elm-starter` is not published in npm yet and it doesn't have a specific command to bootstrap a project, so the way it works now is cloning this repo.

The fastest way is to [click here](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/lucamug/elm-starter). This will automatically clone the repo and publish in Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/lucamug/elm-starter)

Otherwise the steps are:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lucamug/elm-starter
mv elm-starter my-new-project
cd my-new-project
rm -rf .git
npm install
```

Done! `elm-starter` is installed. To start using it you must create your own git repository, add files and make a commit (example: `git init && git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"`). At this point, these are the available commands:

### `$ npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

Edit `src/Main.elm` and save to reload the browser.

Also edit `src/Index.elm` and `package.json` for further customization.

### `$ npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `elm-stuff/elm-starter-files/build` folder.

### `$ npm run serverBuild`

Launches a server in the `build` folder.

Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.

## How to use `elm-starter` in existing Elm application

Let's suppose your existing project is in `my-elm-app`

* Clone `elm-starter` with  
    `$ git clone https://github.com/lucamug/elm-starter.git`
* Copy the folder [`elm-starter/src-elm-starter/`](https://github.com/lucamug/elm-starter/tree/master/src-elm-starter) to `my-elm-app/src-elm-starter/`
* Copy the file [`elm-starter/src/Index.elm`](https://github.com/lucamug/elm-starter/blob/master/src/Index.elm) to `my-elm-app/src/Index.elm`
* Copy the function `conf` from [`elm-starter/src/Main.elm`](https://github.com/lucamug/elm-starter/blob/master/src/Main.elm#L33) to `my-elm-app/src/Main.elm` (remember also to expose it)
* If you don't have `package.json` in your project, add one with `$ npm init`
* Be sure that you have these values in `package.json` as they will be used all over the places:

  * "name" - An npm-compatible name (cannot contain spaces)
  * "nameLong" - The regular name used all over the places, like in the `<title>` of the page, for example
  * "description"
  * "author"
  * "twitterSite" - A reference to a Twitter handle (Just the id without "@")
  * "twitterCreator" - Another Twitter handle, refer to [Twitter cards markups]([https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/)  tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/markup)
  * "version"
  * "homepage"
  * "license"
  * "snapshotWidth" - default: 700 px
  * "snapshotHeight" - default: 350 px
  * "themeColor" - default: { "red": 15, "green": 85, "blue": 123 }

* Add `node` dependencies with these commands

    ```sh
    npm install --save-dev chokidar-cli
    npm install --save-dev concurrently
    npm install --save-dev elm
    npm install --save-dev elm-live
    npm install --save-dev html-minifier
    npm install --save-dev puppeteer
    npm install --save-dev terser
    ```

* Add `src-elm-starter` as an extra `source-directory` in `elm.json`, the same as in `elm-starter/elm.json`
* Add these commands to `package.json` (or run them directly)

    ```json
      "scripts": {
        "start":       "node ./src-elm-starter/starter.js start",
        "build":       "node ./src-elm-starter/starter.js build",
        "serverBuild": "node ./src-elm-starter/starter.js serverBuild"
      },
    ```

Done!

## Netlify

When setting up the app with Netlify, input these in the deploy configuration:

* Build command: `npm run build` (or `node ./src-elm-starter/starter.js start`)
* Publish directory: `elm-stuff/elm-starter-files/build`

## (\*) Applications working without Javascript

Working without Javascript depends on the application. The `elm-starter` example works completely fine also without Javascript, the only missing thing is the smooth transition between pages.

The `elm-todomvc` example requires Javascript. Note that in this example, compared to Evan's original TodoMVC, I slightly changed the CSS to improve the a11y (mainly lack of contrast and fonts too small).

The `elm-spa-example` partially works without Javascript. You can browse across pages but the counters are not working.

`elm-starter` and `elm-todomvc` use `Browser.element`, while `elm-spa-example` use `Browser.application`.

The setup for these two cases is a bit different. `Browser.application` requires to use `htmlToReinject` (see `Index.elm`) because Elm is wiping out all the content in the body. Also the node where Elm attach itself needs to be removed (see `node.remove()` ).

The working folder of `elm-starter` is `elm-stuff/elm-starter-files`. These files are automatically generated and should not be edited directly, unless during some debugging process.

## Advanced stuff

## File generation

* Most of the logic is written in Elm, including the code to generate all necessary files:
  * `index.html` (generated from [`Index.elm`](https://github.com/lucamug/elm-start-private/blob/master/src/Index.elm) using [`zwilias/elm-html-string`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/zwilias/elm-html-string/latest/))
  * [`sitemap.txt`](https://elm-starter.guupa.com/sitemap.txt)
  * [`manifest.json`](https://elm-starter.guupa.com/manifest.json)
  * [`service-worker.js`](https://elm-starter.guupa.com/service-worker.js)
  * [`robots.txt`](https://elm-starter.guupa.com/robots.txt)

## Disabling pre-rendering

Is possible to disable pre-rendering just passing an empty list to `Main.conf.urls`. In this case the app will work as "Full CSR" (Full Client-side Rendering)

## How to customize your project

The main two places where you can change stuff are:

* `src/Index.elm`
* `src/Main.elm` (`conf` function)

`elm-starter` is opinionated about many things. If you want more freedom, you can change stuff in

* `src-elm-starter/**/*.elm`

The reason `Main.conf` is inside `Main.elm` is so that it can exchange data. For example:

* `title`: `Main.conf` -> `Main`
* `urls`: `Main.conf` <- `Main`

Moreover `Main.conf` is used by `src-elm-starter` to generate all the static files.

## elm-console-debug.js for nice console output

Support [https://github.com/kraklin/elm-debug-transformer](https://github.com/kraklin/elm-debug-transformer) out of the box for nice `Debug.log` messages in the console.

## Changing meta-tags

For better SEO, you should update meta-tags using the predefined port `changeMeta` that you can use this way:

```json
Cmd.batch
    [ changeMeta { querySelector = "title", fieldName = "innerHTML", content = title }
    , changeMeta { querySelector = "meta[property='og:title']", fieldName = "content", content = title }
    , changeMeta { querySelector = "meta[name='twitter:title']", fieldName = "value", content = title }
    , changeMeta { querySelector = "meta[property='og:image']", fieldName = "content", content = image }
    , changeMeta { querySelector = "meta[name='twitter:image']", fieldName = "content", content = image }
    , changeMeta { querySelector = "meta[property='og:url']", fieldName = "content", content = url }
    , changeMeta { querySelector = "meta[name='twitter:url']", fieldName = "value", content = url }
    ]
```

You can validate Twitter preview cards at [https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)

## Configuration

You can verify the configuration in real-time using elm reactor:

```sh
node_modules/.bin/elm reactor
```

and check the page

[http://localhost:8000/src-elm-starter/Application.elm](http://localhost:8000/src-elm-starter/Application.elm)

## Globally available objects

There are three global objects available

### `ElmStarter`

`ElmStarter` contain metadata about the app:

```json
{ commit: "abf04f3"   // coming from git
, branch: "master"    // coming from git
, env: "dev"          // can be "dev" or "prod"
, version: "0.0.5"    // coming from package.json
}
```

This data is also available in Elm through Flags.

### `ElmApp`

`ElmApp` is another global object that contains the handle of the Elm app.

### `Elm`

This is the object exposed by the compiler used to initialize the application.

## Limitations

* Javascript and CSS to generate the initial `index.html` are actually strings :-(
* `src-elm-starter/starter.js`, the core of `elm-starter`, is ~330 lines of Javascript. I wish it could be smaller
* If your Elm code relies on data only available at runtime, such as window size or dark mode, prerendering is probably not the right approach. In this case you may consider [disabling pre-rendering](#disabling-pre-rendering) and use other alternatives, such as [Netlify prerendering](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/post-processing/prerendering/#set-up-prerendering)

Note

* The smooth rotational transition in the demo only works in Chrome. I realized it too late, but you get the picture

## Non-goals

Things that `elm-starter` is not expected to do

* Doesn't generate Elm code automatically, like Route-parser, for example
* Doesn't touch/wrap the code of your Elm Application
* Doesn't do live SSR (Server Side Render) but just pre-render during the build
* Doesn't change the Javascript coming out from the Elm compiler
* Doesn't create a web site based on static files containing Markdown
* There is no "[hydration](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web)", unless Elm does some magic that I am not aware of.

You can find several of these characteristics in some of the [similar projects](#similar-projects).

Using as reference the table at the bottom of the article [Rendering on the Web](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web), `elm-starter` can support you in these rendering approach

* Static SSR
* CSR with Prerendering
* Full CSR

It cannot help you with

* Server Rendering
* SSR with (re)hydration
